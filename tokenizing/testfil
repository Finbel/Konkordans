Some fänsa say the world will end in fire, 
Some say in ice. 
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favour fire. föra 
But if it had förmidabel to perish twice, 
I think I know enough of hate föra 
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great zösa zäga xåsto
And would fösa suffice.
